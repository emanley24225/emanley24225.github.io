  //Challenges/Confusion
// I generally struggled with the idea of altering the wiget. It felt like the
//code was so small I was unsure whether to try to alter it or add to it
// in an effort to change components.
// I tried to import a new GeoJSON but I could not get it to shown within
// the layer list. So I focused on altering smaller portions of the code
// like the color and the selection process of layers within the list.
